# The Kroc Principles

A guide based on Ray Kroc from *The Founder* — the relentless CEO who built McDonald's into a global empire.

**Warning:** These principles include both what made Kroc effective AND what made him ruthless. Learn from both. The movie doesn't celebrate him uncritically, and neither should you.

## Who is Ray Kroc?

Ray Kroc was a 52-year-old milkshake machine salesman when he discovered the McDonald brothers' burger stand in San Bernardino. He saw what they couldn't: a system that could scale globally. He franchised it, built the empire, and eventually took the company — and the name — from its founders.

Michael Keaton's portrayal shows a man whose greatest strength (relentless persistence) was also his greatest flaw (inability to stop, even when he should).

## Core CEO Principles

### 1. Persistence Is Everything

Kroc was rejected, broke, and failing at 52. He kept going. The movie opens with him pitching milkshake machines to empty diners. He doesn't quit.

> "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence."

**The lesson:** Most people give up too early. Persistence through rejection, failure, and doubt is the baseline requirement for building anything significant.

**The warning:** Persistence without ethics becomes obsession. Know when you're building versus when you're just refusing to let go.

### 2. See What Others Miss

The McDonald brothers saw a successful restaurant. Kroc saw a *system* — replicable, scalable, franchise-able. Same facts, different vision.

**The lesson:** The opportunity is often sitting in plain sight. Everyone else sees a burger stand. You need to see the system underneath.

**The warning:** Vision can become delusion. Kroc saw opportunity; he also convinced himself his takeover was justified. Check your vision against reality.

### 3. Systems Beat Products

Kroc didn't care about burgers. He cared about the Speedee Service System — the process that made burgers fast, consistent, and cheap. The product was interchangeable; the system was the moat.

> "I'm not in the burger business. I'm in the real estate business."

**The lesson:** Don't fall in love with the product. Fall in love with the system that produces it. Systems scale; products don't.

**The warning:** When you reduce everything to systems, you can lose sight of the people inside them — employees, partners, founders.

### 4. Control the Platform

Kroc's breakthrough wasn't franchising burgers — it was realizing McDonald's should own the land under the franchises. The real estate play gave him leverage, cash flow, and control.

**The lesson:** Whoever controls the platform controls the ecosystem. Find the chokepoint. Own it.

**The warning:** Platform control can become exploitation. There's a line between smart business and squeezing your partners dry.

### 5. Move Faster Than the Founders

The McDonald brothers wanted quality control. Kroc wanted speed. They debated; he acted. While they protected their single store, he built an empire around them.

**The lesson:** Speed is a competitive advantage. While others deliberate, you execute.

**The warning:** Speed without alignment creates betrayal. Kroc didn't convince the brothers — he outmaneuvered them. That's a choice with consequences.

### 6. Partners Are Temporary

Kroc worked with the brothers, then worked around them, then worked against them. He brought in new partners (investors, franchisees) when the old ones became obstacles.

**The lesson:** Business relationships serve the mission. When they stop serving it, they change.

**The warning:** This is the darkest Kroc principle. He broke handshake deals. He pushed out the people who created the thing he scaled. "Temporary partners" can mean "people you betray."

### 7. Borrow, Improve, Own

Kroc didn't invent the Speedee System — the brothers did. He didn't invent franchising. He borrowed what worked, improved the business model, and made it his own.

**The lesson:** Originality is overrated. Execution and scale matter more than invention.

**The warning:** There's a line between building on others' work and stealing it. Kroc crossed it. The brothers invented McDonald's and died without the right to use their own name.

### 8. Bet on Yourself When No One Else Will

Kroc mortgaged his house. He went into debt. His wife thought he was crazy. He bet everything on a vision no one else shared.

**The lesson:** If you truly believe, you have to be willing to risk. Conviction without stakes is just talk.

**The warning:** This can destroy your relationships. Kroc's marriage ended. His obsession cost him personally even as it paid off professionally.

### 9. Rewrite the Story

By the end, Kroc had rewritten history. He was the "founder" in the public narrative. The brothers were a footnote. He controlled the story because he controlled the company.

> "If you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean."

**The lesson:** Narrative matters. Whoever tells the story shapes perception. Build the company AND the story about the company.

**The warning:** Rewriting history to erase the people who built the foundation is a moral failure. Kroc did it anyway. That's the uncomfortable truth.

## The Kroc Duality

Every Kroc strength has a shadow:

| Strength | Shadow |
|----------|--------|
| Persistence | Obsession |
| Vision | Delusion |
| Speed | Recklessness |
| Scale thinking | Dehumanization |
| Decisiveness | Ruthlessness |
| Self-belief | Arrogance |

## The Kroc Test

Before acting like Kroc, ask:

1. Am I building something, or just winning?
2. Am I moving fast, or burning bridges?
3. Am I being persistent, or refusing to see reality?
4. Would I be proud of how I got here, or just that I got here?
5. Who gets hurt by this decision? Do I care?

## When to Use Kroc Principles

- When you need to push through rejection
- When you need to see scale others miss
- When you need to move faster than incumbents
- When you need to make hard business decisions

## When to Ignore Kroc Principles

- When "winning" means betraying people who trusted you
- When speed means breaking commitments
- When scale means losing your soul
- When the story you're telling erases the truth

## Summary

Kroc built an empire through persistence, vision, and ruthless execution. He also broke deals, pushed out founders, and rewrote history. Both things are true.

**Use his persistence. Use his systems thinking. Use his speed.**

**But remember the McDonald brothers.**
